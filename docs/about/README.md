# Who we are

Coral Monitoring is an extracurricular activity organized by [Li Po Chun United World College](http://www.lpcuwc.edu.hk/) in Hong Kong. We focus on collecting vital coral health data about the major coral communities at [Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park](http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_mar/cou_vis_mar_des/cou_vis_mar_des_hoi.html), where a [WWF-HK](http://www.wwf.org.hk/en/) Marine Studies Centre has been constructed. LPCUWC Coral Monitors are trained, [PADI-certified](http://www.padi.com/) divers and have received education in marine identification and surveying skills.

The Coral Monitoring group aims to raise awareness on different marine issues that have an impact in Hong Kong as well as on the conditions of the reefs of Hong Kong. This will be done through the accurate collection of data in consecutive years and the drafting of report that will process this data. The information will also reach organizations like [Coralwatch](http://www.coralwatch.org/web/guest) and [Reefcheck](http://www.reefcheck.org/). Awareness will be raised inside and outside the school community with the help of other organisations like [WWF](http://www.wwf.org.hk/en/) and [Greenpeace](http://www.greenpeace.org/).

The service also aims to have an impact on a personal scale for each coral monitor. This way they will bring back to their countries what they have learn and continue raising awareness and supporting the marine environment throughout their lives.
