“As a child, I was able to enjoy snorkelling off of the East African coast when we camped there with my family. Unfortunately, we didn’t know enough about the marine environment to avoid damaging it by walking on the corals and taking shells for souvenirs. It’s therefore a privilege and responsibility to be a part of a long term LPC UWC HK project dedicated to conservation through marine monitoring and awareness raising. The dedication and hard work of many generations of ‘Polyp’ volunteers keeps me inspired, as does participating in the campaigns of established environmental NGOs glocally. We are part of a growing group of LPC UWC HK services with a focus on monitoring and preserving wetland or marine environments. S.O.S! Save Our Seas!”

**Sil Jacobus Alexander Kiewiet de Jonge (Holland/ UK)**

I love the ocean and all its creatures. I hope to prevent people from polluting the ocean and killing marine life by stressing the rapid decrease of marine health in our oceans.

**Cassi Paguio (Philippines)**

I have always been very passionate about the conservation of the marine environment. As a diver, coming from the Philippines, I have been exposed to a vast array of marine biodiversity. The demise of many of my country’s reefs and the rapidly growing pollution of our seas greatly burden me. Taking part in this service has enabled me to further equip myself with knowledge of marine conservation that I will be sure to bring back to my country and use to help better our marine environment’s condition.

**Ching Chang (Chinese)**

There’re few reasons why I wanted to join coral monitoring. I remember I was in primary school,I joined a summer program outside of school which was learning about marine skills in Tai Wan.I was amazing to see the baby sea turtle born and snorkel under the sea .From then on,I’m interested in discovering diverse living things in the ocean.At the same time,I realize it is important to protect this treasure ocean and embark doing something for this ocean. After my few dives from Coral monitoring, I would say it was a wise choice to choose coral monitoring as one of my QC because it is not only a voluntary but also a technique (marine skills,dive etc.) that we can apply after school life. One thing that I appreciate a lot is coral monitoring emphasizes a long term sustainability.
 
**Anders Samdal Solberg (Norway)**

I joined coral monitoring as I believe climate change is the most urgent issue the world is facing today, and to be able to help gather data and spread awareness to fight climate change is wonderful. From what I have learned so far the Hong Kong marine life is in decay, and by doing the research so close to where we live it makes me feel like I am doing my new community a huge favour. (and it is fun!)

**Christie Lai (Chinese)**

I joined this service because I have always loved the ocean. I wish to become a marine biologist and therefore being involved in coral monitoring provides a foundation for my career. I have learnt the importance of peer communication and teamwork as well as the collection of data underwater from the service, and I believe the data that we have collected helps to give a clearer picture of the severity of coral bleaching in Hong Kong. Hence, with statistics, we can give a more convincing message to the public about the importance of marine conservation.

**Caroline Tsai (Hong Kong)**

The Oceans are the largest ecosystems on Earth, and they are home to many marine species. However, many people are unaware of the importance and the beauty of the ocean. Nowadays, global warming and pollution are threatening the ecosystem, and coral reefs all around the world are dying. The local community should be aware of this issue, as these problems should not be ignored. We, as humans, have the responsibility of protecting the ocean. I joined this service because I am passionate about protecting the environment, and I want to lend a helping hand to try to make a difference to the marine world, especially in Hong Kong, which is my home, and contribute to stopping the decline of the beautiful and diverse coral reefs in Hong Kong. Before joining this service, I have already gotten my Open Water Dive Certification, and I have had the opportunity to dive in many places such as Hawaii and the Maldives. I observed that there is a stark contrast between the coral life in these places compared to Hong Kong, and it is worrying to see the precarious situation the coral in Hong Kong are in. During these past months in Coral Monitoring, I have learnt a lot more about the coral reefs, and the integral part they play in the marine ecosystem. I have also learnt about the threats marine life are facing, and the importance of protecting the oceans. Through this service, not only can I improve my knowledge about coral life and the marine ecosystem, I can also help to raise awareness of this issue to my peers and the community. I am extremely grateful to LPC for providing me with this opportunity to play a part in protecting the marine world, and to help change the world.

**Jeanie Li (Chinese)**

I want to study environmental science in the future, so the service is an opportunity to get hands-on experience to see how climate change is affecting us. I’ve learnt to work with different individuals and the importance of doing our job so everything can run smoothly. This service gives the community data and actual evidence that global warming is actually happening and I feel like it would raise a lot of awareness within the community.
 

**Antonia Kostka (Germany)**

I joined Coral Monitoring, because I wanted to get a closer insight in what happens with the marine environment because of the humanity’s behaviour and carelessness. It gives me the opportunity not only to be better informed, but also to inform others and to contribute at least a bit to the protection of corals and the health of the seas. This service spreads out the message of awareness about the state of our marine environment and extends the data collection about corals of global organisations with the same goal. That gives hope to reach a point, where we are actually reducing our negative impacts on this very important part of nature and save the corals before they get into extinction.

**On Tai (Chinese)**

You get the opportunity to dive in Hong Kong by joining coral monitoring! Environmental issues have always been a concern for me. That’s why I join coral monitoring. It’s a great way to both learn about and help the dying Earth. As part of the global village, the environment is something we have to take care. Especially in the 21st century, the world is advanced but not much has been done on the environment. The data we collected from dives can help us or scientist monitor the marine health and situation. We are also raising the awareness through different activities and posters.

**Rim Rawadi (Lebanon)**

97% of the earth’s nature is underwater. Let’s save it and not be shellfish.

**Safoua Berady (Morocco)**

I joined Coral Monitoring because I have had a passion for the environment since I was very little. Morrocco is the second most ecological country in the world, and as a result of this, there is a huge emphasis placed on the environment and sustainability in our school’s curriculum. However, upon coming to LPC, I realized that I did not really know very much about Marine conservation, so I reasoned that Coral Monitoring would thus be an interesting and fulfilling community service to join. 
 

**Wadad Assaf (Lebanon)**

For me, Coral Monitoring was an opportunity to learn more about environmental problems which deeply affect my home country, and also to learn about how the same problem plagues Hong Kong’s corals. Thanks to Coral Monitoring, I’ve been able to realize both of these goals, and I feel as though I am not only learning about the environment but also contributing to help protect it, not just in Hong Kong, but also by taking the skills that I have learned back with me to Lebanon.

## 2016-2018

**Sam Hui (Hong Kong)**

The degradation in the abundance and health of coral reefs, being an overseen issue, is something that needs to be brought to attention in the local community. Apart from wanting to acquire more knowledge concerning the marine environment surrounding us, I also wanted to raise awareness of the decline in coral health and be part of a cause so important and meaningful upon learning the existence of this service opportunity. During these few months in Coral Monitoring, I have learnt that corals are integral to the marine environment because they protect coastlines from the damaging effect of wave action and tropical storms while providing shelter for numerous marine organisms. However, coral reefs are under threat from overfishing, pollution from sewage and agriculture, invasive species etc. It pains me to see the effect of human activity on corals, especially during the first open water dive, where I personally. One action I would want the government, organisations and corporations to take, is to bring to light the issue of decaying corals to the local community, and hopefully, trigger a response within people to donate to respective organisations for coral preservation. Corals are crucial to the marine environment, and there are consequences should we not take action to preserve the health of these magnificent beings.

**Nati Rijo (Uruguay)**

I joined Coral Monitoring because I wanted to be more connected with the marine life and the nature itself, as whilst getting older I felt how I was getting less connected to nature. Everything that this service means was something totally new for me and it made me join the fact that is not only spending time looking at the different features of the ecosystem but taking care of it and following a record of how is developing, what means that your behaviour towards it has an impact. I have learnt how important the different species that lives in an ecosystem are to determines how this is developing and what outside factors are having an impact in it. On the other hand, I have learnt more how the human behaviour is the factor that has the biggest impact and creates big issues in the development and composition of the ecosystem.I will like institutions and individuals to take actions starting from the daily life because I think that will make a big impact in the environment health. Things such as reducing the amount of plastic used, recycling and classifying the trash, informed ourselves of what type of products are harming the ecosystem and start avoiding it, buy organic products if we can afford to them. And one really important thing stand up for the future of our planet.

## 2015-2017

**Musab Shakeel (Pakistan)**

Coming to LPC and having to decide between the plethora of activities and services, I had no trouble in choosing Coral Monitoring as my first choice service. Not only did it give me an opportunity to try something fun and challenging that I had never experienced before, but it also linked closely to the protection and conservation of marine environment which I have now come to value greatly. In today’s world, the threat imposed on the marine life by the selfish, consumerist human society is very serious and in many parts of the world, is unrecognised. Being a part of LPC Coral Monitoring has made me realise how the oceans and seas of this world are under constant threat from us humans, and that there is a dire need to do something about it. Coral Monitoring has hence given me this opportunity to actually make a difference in the society and that too, by combining it with the immensely amusing activity of scuba diving. Since joining this service, life has definitely been busier but with every second spent being completely worth it. Every dive with the team has been a memorable experience and with each dive, the bonding between the Polyps & Planulas becomes stronger. Therefore, this service has not only provided a fun opportunity to contribute to environmental sustainability, but also has provided some close friendships that I greatly value.

**Lara Mutluay (Turkey)**

As an aspiring biologist (-to-be) who already knew and loved diving before coming to Hong Kong, LPC’s Coral Monitoring QC was my first choice among my other service preferences. Coral Monitoring was giving me the opportunity to do structured data collection and analysis whilst doing something which I was already passionate about – diving. Being interested in nature and concerned with its deterioration, I simply couldn’t pass this opportunity. Coral Monitoring is a very time-consuming and challenging QC which requires you to stick to your commitments no matter what, therefore it has taught me to manage my time in a better way. Diving, spending time and cleaning the gear together as a community has granted us the opportunity to bond over the time. It also helped me to grasp the “ugly truth” that (literally) lies beneath the surface. Even though the strenuous effort it requires, Coral Monitoring makes me smile and say “It was worth it!” at the end of the day. In my opinion the biggest threat to the oceans is the indifference of the public’s general attitude towards the condition of marine ecosystems. Society’s indifference is the basis to every ecological problem, and no such problem can be solved without the elimination of the said indifference. Therefore, I would be very happy to raise even a bit of awareness about the deterioration of marine ecosystems as a community.

**Bjorn Eric Larsen (Norway)**

Hey, my name is Bjorn. I am from an island group in Norway. I have been living close to the ocean my whole life and I have developed a close relationship with the sea and the life within it. My passion for the sea have made me appreciate and respect the marine life. It has also made realise that it is our responsibility to protect the vulnerable ecosystem we depend on from the harms of us humans. When I came to Hong Kong and LPC College I was given the opportunity to help and protect the marine life in Hong Kong, but I was also given the opportunity to learn more about the life within the ocean, and to appreciate it in completely new way. Coral Monitoring have showed me how truly amazing it is to be able to observe the beauty of the ocean first hand, but also how close we are to destroying what we are dependent on and love.

## 2014-2016

**Nalani Ivelic Astorga (Chile)**

I have always been passioned about nature, i have been surrounded by it during my whole life and i was taught in a very young age the importance of the environment and how to protect it. By joining Coral Monitoring i am doing three of the things i enjoy and love the most, contributing towards the protection of the marine environment, raising awareness and at the same time diving. The experience of learning about the marine environment with such a beautiful group of people that share the same interests it is amazing. Being part of this QC, of this team, has make merealise how much there isto learn about nature, about the wildlife and how incredible it is. This makes me even more passioned and secure about dedicating my life to the protection of our planet, to protect the nature from the biggest threat, us. We as humans are destroying not just our home, but the home of millions of other species. Oceans are being polluted, we are destroying the habitat of every marine specie by using plastic, oil and many others, we are leading to the extinction of countless number of species just because of the excess of superiority and the lack of awareness. This is the reason I am, and love to be, in Coral Monitoring.

**Jimmy Jiang (Singapore/ HK)**

“I want to join coral monitoring because I’ve always been fascinated by marine life.” These were the words, in verbatim, that I recall saying in the interview. In retrospect, nothing has changed – every dive is something new and unique per se. My love and insatiable desire to be in the deep blue will never wither – in fact, it has been stronger than ever. However, due to instances of overfishing and malpractice in our oceans, corals and fishes are declining rapidly, and we must do something about it. Therefore, to be bestowed with the opportunity to change our environment for the better is one I will always be grateful for. I am confident that our seas will see its glory days once again; I am confident that change is possible, no matter how small; I am confident that our work will transcend the two years we spend with this service.

**Max Ferguson (Hong Kong)**

Hiiiii, I’m Max and I care about the sea because it makes up most of our planet and I really don’t think it’s fair that humans destroy something that we really shouldn’t have tamper with. I joined the coral team because let’s be honest who doesn’t want to learn how to dive? But also it’s really really sickass that my school gives me a way of actually doing something to help the sea! I think that it’s really sad that lots of fish are dying unnecessarily, especially those that are caught as by catch. We need to learn what other fish are perfectly okay to eat rather than just overfishing the typical ones like tuna and halibut and throwing away the ‘unwanted’ fish.

**Lina Beron Ech (Ecuador)**

My connection with the sea involves various individuals, a chain of sunsets, the scatter of ashes; it is death but also healing master. Coral monitoring grants me an objective glimpse on the immense blue and allows me to see all the life I ignore as I stare into a sunset or plunge into the waves. This is where I become one of the few witnesses of the rapid destruction of Hong Kong’s reefs. I am most certain that the best way to understand, learn and create awareness is by being directly exposed to the situation; Coral Monitoring strives to do so in the most communal of all ways.

**Lyndon Whittaker (USA)**

Ayyy, my name is Lyndon and I love the ocean because of the amazing and beautiful life that can be found in the ocean. The ocean is so awesome and there are many mysteries contained in its depths. I’ve always had a fascination with the ocean. I joined Coral Monitoring so that I could explore my fascination and try something new and interesting that I could never do in my landlocked state of Tennessee in the U.S. I also wanted to learn how to better protect such a large part of our planet, 71% actually. So far I have truly enjoyed my experience and I cannot wait to learn more.

**Ebisan Ekperigin (Nigeria)**

Heyo, my name is Ebisan and I love the sea :). Why wouldn’t I? What’s there not to love? The sea produces the most amazing things we see in the planet. We find things on land in the sea! but the reverse is not the case, yet, so many people make it their personal responsibility to destroy the sea and all its contents. “ Don’t let the sea be your universal trash bin”.  This is what i always tell people the sea is a lovely place once you experience its beauty. This is why I joined the coral monitors, so I could experience the beauty of the sea and fall into deeper love. I will always protect what I love, I will always protect the sea!

**Gabrielle Armstrong (New Zealand)**

**Jolie Lau (HK)**

“I joined Coral Monitoring because I want to be a marine/wildlife biologist after graduation. It is my passion to dive and to have contact with the nature. As a local Hong Kong student who lived in Hong Kong for my entire life, I realised how horrible the ecosystem is in HK, especially when you dive into the ocean — if the visibility is over 4 metres, it is already a miracle. That is why I hope to learn more about what is going on, how to preserve our environment and what we can do to enchant our world back into its nature colours.”

**Lucy Green (UK)**

“I think it is an amazing opportunity to be able to help the local marine environment and to be able to educate the other students on campus on what we are doing but also expanding the audience and aiming to create more interest in the problems occurring in the marine environment. I also want to transfer the skills I learn in this service to other activities I might be involved in in the future.”

**Mirva Laatunen (Finland)**

“I joined Coral Monitoring because I think that this is great opportunity to do something for the marine life and try something where I can challenge myself. I had been interested in the environment for quite a long time but the moment when I realised that I really want to do something for it was when I arrived to Hong Kong. It was shocking to see how polluted the ocean is. I’m also looking forward to learn new skills and get new experiences.”

**Monika Rull (Estonia)**

“I joined coral monitoring because I really love sea and water activities. I have been windsurfing and kitesurfing for already 7 years. The situation of marine life is important to me and I would like to help making positive changes and rise awareness about that topic. Balanced marine ecosystem is vital and it affects basically everybody.”

**Nancy Hui (HK)**

“Finally, I am a coral monitor now! My reason of being a member of coral monitoring team is quite simple. I would like to know more about marine environment and how to prevent our beautiful oceans from further pollution. Hong Kong has rich marine resources, for example, various kinds of coral. However, the water pollution problem is so serious that we can seldom see blue sea in Hong Kong. People don’t pay much attention on protecting the marine ecosystem. I hope that after these two years of training and doing services, I can learn more and raise the awareness of people on environmental protection.”

**Neil Barooah (India)**

“Hello everyone!! I am Neil from India. I am really excited about Coral Monitoring. I feel it is a wonderful opportunity that Li Po Chun is providing to its students and it is definitely for a good cause. I hope to learn a lot  of new things and acquire new skills. I am sure it will be a great experience and I will contribute as much as I can to protect the magnificient marine environment :)”

**Arthur Lee (Hong Kong)**

“I am Arthur Lee from Hong Kong. I have been swimming since I was five. A person who loves aquatic activities, I find coral monitoring superb, meaningful and fun. It not only enables me to experience diving, but also gives me a chance to explore the marine environment.”

**Barbora Hanzalová (Czech Republic)**

“Have you seen a coral reef in Hong Kong? Have you seen The Coral Reef in Sipadan? They looked similarly before few tenths of years.  I do not want to let all the Sipadans to look like Hong Kong the time my grandchildren are grown up!”

**Chloe Lau (Hong Kong)**

“Hi! I am Chloe from Hong Kong and it has a been an amazing experience to learn scuba diving and be actively involved in environmental protection in the past year. Coral monitoring opens my eyes to a whole new world- the underwater palace. Spending a week in Sipadan,Malaysia inspire me to look at the ocean from a whole new perspective, and seeing all those amazing creatures prompted me to spread the message of saving our oceans, our Earth. Never had I thought I could have the ability to protect the seas, but here it is — it may be a big commitment but you know you can do so much more in the future!”

**Dilene Mugenzi (Canada)**

**Halfdan Kjaer (Denmark)**

“Coral Monitoring has opened my eyes to the marine environment. It is a sort of other world – a world I knew existed, but maybe did not realise the importance and complexity of. The service continues to challenge me when it comes to team work and personal sacrifice, whilst it equipping me with knowledge of the marine environment, understanding of scientific methods, and, most importantly, a belief that we, collectively, can make a difference.”

**Hannah Read (Ireland)**

“I’m Hannah from Ireland, and I joined coral monitoring predominantly because I was very big into water sports before I came to LPC, particularly kayaking and swimming.  Being a coral monitor has really been a huge part of my life in Li Po Chun, and I feel that I’ve really learnt from it. From dressing up as a panda to seeing countless sharks and turtles in Malaysia, I’ve definitely become much more aware of the issues facing the marine world, and will try my utmost to prevent them in the future.”

**Khetiwe Motlana (South Africa)**

Khet Profile Picture“Coral Monitoring is a chance for me to expand my passion for the environment. I believe that this service will provide me with the basic skills I need and allow the passion I have for the environment to grow. This service provides the platform for students, to take the initiative to get involved in environmental projects that they are passionate about and to start projects through the service. It has been an amazing opportunity not only to learn about the marine environment but also to encourage others to be aware of the effects that we as human beings have of the environment.”

**Kishi Ganzorigt (Mongolia)**

**Kim Ah-Chong (Mauritius)**

“I wanted to join Coral Monitoring since coming from a tropical island I always felt extremely close to the ocean. The coral reefs are fundamental for the sustainability of the Mauritian economy since tourism is one of our main source of income. For many years now our reefs have brought our Island so many tourists that we never realised how lucky we were to have such a beautiful marine ecosystem. Recently Mauritians have noticed the deterioration in our coral reefs and when I heard about Coral monitoring i found it a great opportunity not only for me but also for my Country.”

**Laura Duque (Colombia)**

“I wanted to be part of Coral Monitoring since I first heard of LPC because it was a service related to the marine environment and I wanted to explore this area. Is amazing to see how much we have learn about marine environment, diving and ID skills but also about raising awareness. The most important part of this service is that it engages  people to continue taking action regarding the conservation of the oceans which are a very important part of our lives. Diving in Malaysia during project week was the experience that allowed me to compare and see how human impact has damage the reefs in Hong Kong. Even if what we do is a small part of the big picture I think it is a start point and is very useful to inspire us. ”

**Maxim Moshnyakov (Finland)**

Maxim's profile picture“I was always interested in environmental issues and taking new challenges, so the Coral Monitoring was one of the reasons why I applied to LPC. I was not disappointed for a single second – it has been a great pleasure to be in a service that is actually beneficial and important.  I have developed new skills and I have learnt a lot about marine environment, the importance of corals to the oceans and consequently to humans; it has also made me more aware and concerned about other environmental issues back home. ”

**Mia Thayer (Argentina / USA)**

“I grew up in a city in China on the Pearl River Delta and very clearly remember the day 4 years ago, when I jumped into the sea with my friends wearing a green bathing suit and came out of the water with a brown bathing suit. I was deeply affected by this incident and joined Coral Monitoring because I wanted to learn about our oceans and how humans are changing and affecting everything about them. I have learnt so much in the past year and cannot thank CM enough for the knowledge and experiences it has given me.”

**Oda Nissen (Norway)**

“I was into diving even before coming to LPC, but being a Coral Monitor here has taught me so much more about the ocean than simply seeing it as a beautiful and amazing place. The programme trains us to become aware of the dangers the oceans of the world are facing today, some of the solutions, and mostly: how we ourselves can make a change, both as a team and by ourselves in the future. I am proud to say that we can do this, spread awareness and make a difference.”

**Nick Archer (Bahamas)**

**Guillermo Martinez Cabalga (Spain)**

**Aine Doyle (Ireland)**

“Being a coral monitor has been one of my most fulfiling experiences to date, and not just because of an incredible week spent diving in Sipadan, Malaysia. In my opinion, Coral does, and indeed should, go far beyond learning marine identification and basic data collection skills. There is a limit to how skilled we become in two years, but no limit to the action it can inspire.

My experience with our vibrant, international team (teachers included) is that Coral certainly leaves us longing for more; more diving, more conservation, more information and above al,l more awareness. As I move from LPC, I hope to raise greater awareness of both the beauty of our marine ecosystems, and the dangers facing them. I hope to raise my own awareness of coral reefs and marine biology. I’m not entirely sure how to manage this, but I do know that Coral has enriched my world view such that I know it’s possible. Thank you to Polyps 10-12, and to all those supporting and involved with this fantastic initiative.”

**Antonio Coppola (Italy)**

Hi! I am Antonio and I hail from Pompei, Italy. I graduated from LPCUWC in 2012 and am currently studying at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Being part of the Coral Monitoring team during my time at LPC was a very rewarding commitment, which strengthened my self-discipline and sense of duty toward the environment. Being in contact with the wrecked coral reefs of Hong Kong, I witnessed the damage inflicted by uncontrolled human activities upon ecosystems. As a result I felt exposed more than ever to the significance of environmental preservation, and resolved to maintain – as far as I can – a lifestyle which is respectful towards our environment. Besides, the experience of data collection taught me much about the methods of the ecological sciences: laying a transect line underwater or looking amongst the rocks for invertebrates to log, I learnt a great deal about the kind of methodical observation necessary for the study of natural populations.

“How can one not be proud to be a coral monitor? There are few – if any – activities where you can scuba dive and sunbathe (read sunburn for pasty North Americans like me) in the process of doing meaningful and productive service. I never would have learnt so much about the marine environment and the devilishly tasty local dishes that explain its destruction or had the opportunity to break from campus stress on those warm Saturday mornings. Working on data, I learnt a great deal about Coral Watch and our contribution to a much broader global effort against coral reef degradation. It was fun and fascinating.

Since graduating from LPC, I have  travelled to Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) with Princeton University to explore the direct effects of extreme temperatures on coral reefs and examine the mechanisms for zooxanthellae expulsion and coral death. Ultimately, the class looked at whether adaptation and acclimation in corals could keep pace with global climate change. There was some beach and sun there too, of course.”

**Michelle Kwok (Australia)**

“Most of my best memories of LPC were from Coral Monitoring. Coral introduced me to the wonderful world of scuba diving, and the interesting places and beautiful people that came with it. I have since gotten my advanced open water, and am hope to keep diving for a long time. The thing is, I loved eating seafood. And I still do. But diving gave me a new appreciation of marine life alive in their natural habitat, and not steamed and garnished on my plate. I have become aware of the consequences of my consumption, and I now refrain from eating endangered fish, and especially shark fin. POLYPS.”

“I can proudly say that coral monitoring was one of the proudest moments in my LPC life. I met new people, I went to amazing countries and ate amazing food, but I think most important in my generation’s time, is that I found a way to try and conserve this planets health in a way that I enjoyed and felt efficient in. Not only did coral monitoring allow me to marvel at the amazing life that you don’t get to see everyday, whilst I was being marvelled, I learnt. I learnt biology, even more specifically, marine-biology. I learnt about environmental science, a little bit of maths, and I learnt to appreciate. I appreciate the delicacy and dangers of diving, of interacting with the marine world, but I also appreciate the people I was able to go through this with and who made coral monitoring the beginning of my marine life interactions.”

**Adrian Odio Cortes (Costa Rica)**

“Coral Monitoring was the most meaningful activity I ever did in HK. It instiled in me an enormous interest in marine biology and thanks to all my experiences there I can proudly say that I am an ocean defender. I am about to go and volunteer for a few months on a remote island in Costa Rica, where I will help to protect marine wildlife. All this possibilities I have nowadays came because of what I learnt at LPC, more specifically through Coral Monitoring, the best Quan Cai.”
