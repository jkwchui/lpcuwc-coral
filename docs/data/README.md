## Summary

Students from Li Po Chun United World College (LPCUWC) surveyed three coral communities within the Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park in the Sai Kung Country Park, Hong Kong.  Both underwater and above-water data were collected for four years from 2013 to 2017.  The sites were selected for their variation to wave exposure and initial substrate coverage.

**Underwater** data, collected by students trained in scuba diving and marine identification, uses the Reef Check and Coral Watch protocols and surveys each dive site twice (Fall and Spring).  **Above water** data comprises of monthly measurements of atmospheric variables (humidity, air temperature, and wind direction), water temperature, acidity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity.

Our findings indicate significant ecological damage at all sites.  The extent varies.  Light, moderate, and complete destruction was observed at Site 2, Coral Beach, and Site 5B respectively.  Site 5B saw its coral coverage decrease from 50% to 0%.   We documented algal bloom, diadema population explosion, drupella invasion, barnacle overgrowth, and bleaching events.

The coral colonies accumulated over centuries have seen significant damage in the past four years, and the impact on some sites may already be irreversible.  We recommend urgent conservation and remediation efforts.

This research is a joint project between LPCUWC and WWF Hong Kong.
