往年，大家對五一黃金週嘅印象就係大量中国人到香港消費，受益嘅只有奢侈品商店。試問，呢種消費模式係香港需要的嗎? 我相信，大家都唔會認為係需要嘅。

所以，今個✋☝️黃金週係改變呢個現象嘅好機會。

今時今日，喺武漢肺炎同港共政府雙重打擊之下，市道越黎越差，各行各業進入咗寒冬期。 雖然我哋有黃色經濟圈，但係，宜家大家因爲疫情關係，減少外出，各行各業的黃色商店生意大減，苦不堪言。喺過去兩個月，有部份黃店因虧蝕過多而被迫結業。

所以，我哋香港人更應該團結起來，喺✋☝️黃金週振興黃色經濟圈，大量幫襯黃店，務求令一眾黃店度過這段寒冬期。

另外，我哋香港人亦應大量設計🤚☝️黃金週文宣，嘗試以量取勝，令香港人一見到五一黃金週，就會聯想起「五大訴求，缺一不可」。同時，中国人亦會玻璃心發作，而對🤚☝️黃金週感到極抗拒，從而光復✋☝️黃金週。

What has been your lasting impression of the May 1st Golden Week? The first thing that comes to mind would be the large influx of tourism from Mainland China for the purpose of purchasing high-end branded products, benefitting only luxury stores. Does this form of consumption holistically benefit Hong Kong socially and economically? I believe we would all think otherwise.

This coming ✋☝️Golden Week is the perfect time to change this.

Hong Kong has been going through one storm after the other, from both the HK government and CCP, and the Wuhan Virus to top it off. This has severely impacted not only the daily lives of Hongkongers but also independently-owned businesses. Although we have been maintaining the “yellow economy”, social distancing has been straining on our efforts of contributing to the economic circle. It is an understatement that this has taken a toil on our yellow businesses the past two months - some stores had no choice but to close down.

Hongkongers, let us support each other like never before during this difficult season by strengthening the yellow economy and boosting our consumption rate at yellow stores during the ✋☝️HK Golden Week.

We encourage you all to creatively design promotions for 🤚☝️Hong Kong Golden Week. With the mass promotion, this allows us Hongkongers to naturally correlate the May 1st Golden Week with our “5 demands, not 1 less”. Similarly, pro-beijing Mainland Chinese will be passionately opposed towards this Week. Together, we can redefine the ✋☝️ Golden Week.
