We monitor 5 dive sites in Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park annually, using protocols from Reef Check and Coral Watch.  These dive sites were chosen for being the best coral sites when the baseline measurements were taken in 2007.

At each site we monitor 100m transects that follow the contour of the coral reefs.  Due to low visibility and light penetration, these reefs are usually located at depths <3m.
