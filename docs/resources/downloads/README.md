## Hoi Ha Wan Reef Health Report 2015-16

Reef check surveys were conducted at three coral sites in the Hoi Ha Wan (海下灣) Marine Park in Sai Kung (西貢), Hong Kong. This interim report, comparable to previous studies (since 2007) by the same group, presents both above-water data on monthly measurements of atmospheric variables (humidity, air temperature, and wind direction), water temperature, acidity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity, and underwater data which provides information on coral health at the three sites.

## Hoi Ha Wan Reef Health Report 2014-15

Reef check surveys were conducted at three coral sites in the Hoi Ha Wan (海下灣) Marine Park in Sai Kung (西貢), Hong Kong. Both underwater and above-water data were collected. Underwater data, collected by students trained in scuba diving and marine identification, uses the Reef Check and Coral Watch protocols and surveys each dive site twice (Fall and Spring). Above water data comprises of monthly measurements of atmospheric variables (humidity, air temperature, and wind direction), water temperature, acidity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. Compared to the previous year, we observed diminished algae overgrowth, but unprecedented mass bleaching in both Coral Beach and Site 5.

## Hoi Ha Wan Reef Health Report 2007

Reef check surveys were conducted at 5 coral sites within the Hoi Ha Wan (海下灣) Marine Park in Sai Kung (西貢), Hong Kong.  In this report, we outline the procedure and provide a summary of the data collected in 2006/2007.  The data in this year was compiled by Ms. Julie Harris, and serves as the baseline for assessing the health of the reefs in subsequent years.
